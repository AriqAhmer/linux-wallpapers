# Linux Wallpapers
My take and derivatives on the "Saffron" wallpaper concept from the Ubuntu wallpaper competition for Kinetic Kudu 22.10.

The original wallpaper can be found [here in this link](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/kinetic-kudu-22-10-wallpaper-competition/30319/3).

After I had posted my initial concepts for Ubuntu, Arch and Mint over on Facebook, I really got a lot of positive feedbacks ♥️! and a few requests!!
So this repo contains the original SVGs I edited. The PNGs can be found in the Google drive folders linked below:

Feel free to download and edit to your liking!

Currently I have managed to make the following distro's wallpapers (mobile and desktop) as per requests (in alphabetical order):
- Arch
- Debian
- Fedora
- Garuda
- Kali
- Mint
- Nix OS
- Nobara
- Steam OS
- Ubuntu

Enjoy!!!
